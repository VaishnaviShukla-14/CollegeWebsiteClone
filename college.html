                <p class="F1">Since 1867, Liverpool has awarded more than 100,000 degrees in the professions, arts, sciences and humanities.
                    Liverpool ranks among the highest producers of the nation's Black professionals in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, 
                    engineering, nursing, architecture, religion, law, music, social work and education.<br><br>
                    
                    The University has long held a commitment to the study of disadvantaged persons in American society and throughout
                    the world. The goal is the elimination of inequities related to race, color, social, economic and political circumstances.
                    Through its traditional and cutting-edge academic programs, the University seeks to improve the circumstances of all people in the search 
                    for peace and justice on earth.</p>

            <div id="Ceremony"  class="item"><h3 class="texth3">Graduation Ceremony</h3>
                <p class="F1">The graduation ceremonies are formal occasions and it is respectfully requested that graduates and guests dress appropriately 
                    for the occasion. Suggestions for appropriate attire underneath academic robes would be a lounge suit, shirt and tie, or a skirt/trousers 
                    and shirt/blouse.<br><br> Footwear should also be formal although you should be aware that, if you are able to, you will be required 
                    to use stairs to access the room - please therefore choose your footwear carefully. <br>

                    You are also reminded that all graduates are required to wear their mortar boards throughout the proceedings.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Library" class="item"><h3 class="texth3">Library</h3>
                <p class="F1">An Academic library is a library that is attached to a higher education institution and serves two complementary purposes: to support the curriculum
                    and the research of the university faculty and students.<br><br>
                    Academic libraries must determine a focus for collection development since comprehensive collections are not feasible.<br>
                    These collections are often the basis of a special collection department and may include original papers, artwork, 
                    and artifacts written or created by a single author or about a specific subject.
                </p>

                    As a celebration of Liverpool’s year as European Capital of Culture, the building has been carefully renovated and transformed into a public venue for all to enjoy.
                    The history behind the building is just as interesting as the treasures it contains.

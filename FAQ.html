                    <p>When a student is accepted by their Firm choice university their Insurance choice becomes invalid, even if the student has met the conditions of their Insurance offer.
                        If the student is sure that they do not want to attend their Firm choice they can ask the University to release them into Clearing.<br> This will allow the student to reapply to their Insurance University
                        through the Clearing process. Please note students must check that their insurance university is willing to accept
                        them on to their chosen course through Clearing before they request to be released from their firm choice.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to take mitigating circumstances into consideration after results have been released as places on courses will have already been allocated.
                        If a student has mitigating circumstances that they would like Liverpool to take into consideration, these must be disclosed prior to results being released. Ideally details of the circumstances should be sent by the school or college directly to the Admissions team at uguk@liverpool.ac.uk.<br>
                        <br>
                    Whether or not we can accept students whose circumstances have prevented them from fulfilling the conditions of their offer will depend on how far they have missed the required grades by and also the number of places available on their chosen course.</p>

                    <p>Student B had an offer for BSc Economics at Liverpool conditional on achieving AAA. This was their first choice. The student was awarded grades of ABB and Liverpool has accepted them on to BA Business Economics. If we are unable to accept an applicant on to their chosen course, where possible we will offer a place on an alternative course which is closely related to their original choice. 
                        <br><br>There is no obligation on the applicant to accept the alternative course. We advise that they research the course thoroughly online before accepting or declining it. The Applicant is able to accept or decline the course on UCAS Track. If the offer is declined the student will automatically become CF at their Insurance University</p>
